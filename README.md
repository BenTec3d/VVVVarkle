VVVVarkle is an online multiplayer dice game based on the Farkle ruleset.<br>
The game requires the use of a MQTT broker.<br>
Login data to a demo instance is provided, though it might not always be available.<br>
You can deploy your own MQTT instance for free at: https://www.shiftr.io/<br>
<br>
<br>
Known issues:<br>
The mouse ray does not get the updated screen size when going fullscreen.<br>
This is an issue with the Stride Engine and not something I can fix.<br>
As a workaround I disabled the ability to go into fullscreen mode.<br>
