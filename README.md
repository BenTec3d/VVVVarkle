VVVVarkle is an online multiplayer dice game based on the Farkle rules.<br>
The game requires the use of a MQTT broker.<br>
Login data to a demo instance is provided, though it might not always be available.<br>
You can deploy your own MQTT instance for free at: https://www.shiftr.io/<br>
<br>
<br>
There is a bug with the mouse ray acting unpredictable when changing the window size.<br>
Fullscreen mode is disabled for the same reason.<br>
This seems to be caused by a bug in the Stride Engine.<br>
